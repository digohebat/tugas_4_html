	<p align="right">The Italian, along with teammate Jorge Lorenzo, has been competing on the <br>World stage for 16 straight years – the third highest on the grid behind <br>Valentino Rossi (Movistar Yamaha MotoGP) and Dani Pedrosa (Repsol Honda <br>Team). It's huge testament to the 32-year-old, who in the last two years has <br>been – on paper - Marc Marquez' (Repsol Honda Team) most consistent <br>challenger.</p>
